// Expressions

/* An expression is "a sequence of operators and
 * operands that specifies a computation". it is
 * the most basic building block of a program.
 * Examples:
 *
 * 34           // literal
 * scores       // variable
 * 3.2 + 4.1    // addition
 * 4 * 5        // multiplication
 * c > d        // relational
 * a = b        // assignment */

 // Statements

 /* A statement is a complete line of code that
  * performs some action. Usually terminated in
  * semicolon; usually containing expressions.
  *
  * C++ has several types of statement: expression,
  * null, compound, selection, iteration,
  * declaration, jump, try blocks etc.
  * Examples:
  *
  * int x;                                      // declaration
  * score = 42;                                 // assignment
  * 32 + (32 * 0.7);                            // expression
  * if (a > b) cout << "a is greater than b");  // if
  * ;                                           // null */
